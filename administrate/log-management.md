Log management is currently only available through our API and [clever-tools]({{< ref "/getting-started/cli.html" >}}).

## Get continuous logs from your application

You can see logs with the command down below.

```bash
clever logs
```

You can also add a flag `--before` or `--after` followed by a date (ISO8601 format).

```bash
clever logs --before 2016-08-11T14:54:33.971Z
```

### Access logs

It contains all incoming requests to your application. Here is an example:

```txt
255.255.255.255 - - [06/Feb/2020:07:59:22 +0100] "GET /aget/to/your/beautiful/website -" 200 1453
```

They are available in different formats, the most common is CLF which stands for Common Log Format.

You can see access logs with the following command:

```bash
clever accesslogs
```

As with the `logs` command, you can specify `--before` and `--after` flags as well as the `--follow`  to display access logs continuously.

If you need to change the ouput you can specify the `--format` flag with one of these values:

- simple: `2021-06-25T10:11:35.358Z 255.255.255.255 GET /`
- extended: `2021-06-25T10:11:35.358Z [ 255.255.255.255 - Nantes, FR ] GET www.clever-cloud.com / 200`
- clf: `255.255.255.255 - - [25/Jun/2021:12:11:35 +0200] "GET / -" 200 562`
- json:
  
  ```json
    {
        "t":"2021-06-25T10:11:35.358209Z",
        "a":"app_xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",

        "r":"01F91AEG8Z9RJKYB7JY7H56FNB",
        "tlsV":"TLS1.3"
    }
  ```

## Exporting logs to an external tools

You can use the logs drains to send your application's logs to an external server with the following command.

```bash
clever drain create [--alias <alias>] <DRAIN-TYPE> <DRAIN-URL> [--username <username>] [--password <password>]
```

Where `DRAIN-TYPE` is one of:

- `TCPSyslog`: for TCP syslog endpoint;
- `UDPSyslog`: for UDP syslog endpoint;
- `HTTP`: for TCP syslog endpoint (note that this endpoint has optional username/password parameters as HTTP Basic Authentication);
- `ElasticSearch`: for ElasticSearch endpoint (note that this endpoint requires username/password parameters as HTTP Basic Authentication);
- `DatadogHTTP`: for Datadog endpoint (note that this endpoint needs your Datadog API Key).

You can list the currently activated drains with this command.

```bash
clever drain [--alias <alias>]
```

And remove them if needed

```bash
clever drain remove [--alias <alias>] <DRAIN-ID>
```

If the status of your drain is shown as `DISABLED` without you disabling it, it may be because we  have not been able to send your logs to your drain endpoint or because the requests timed out after 25 seconds.

You can also use the logs drain to send your add-on's logs by using `--addon` flag, the value must be the add-on id starting by `addon_`. 

### Elasticsearch

ElasticSearch drains use the Elastic bulk API. To match this endpoint, specify `/_bulk` at the end of your ElasticSearch endpoint.

```bash
clever drain create ElasticSearch https://xxx-elasticsearch.services.clever-cloud.com/_bulk --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD
```

Each day, we will create an index `logstash-<yyyy-MM-dd>` and push logs to it.

### Datadog

To create a [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/fr/api/latest/logs/#send-logs) drain, you just need to use:

```bash
clever drain create DatadogHTTP "https://http-intake.logs.datadoghq.com/v1/input/<API_KEY>?ddsource=clevercloud&service=<SERVICE>&hostname=<HOST>"
```

{{ < alert "warning" "zone" > }}
Datadog has two zones, **EU** and **COM**. An account on one zone is not available on the other, make sure to target the right intake endpoint (`datadoghq.eu` or `datadoghq.com`).
{{ < /alert > }}

## Logs extended storage

Each organisations or personal space has a `Logs extended storage` Cellar addon.
This addon will be used to store your applications/addons logs when the hot retention is reached when the feature will be available.

The most aged logs will be pushed to `Logs extended storage` as cold storage.
The retention for cold storage will be user defined via a new log management interface.
